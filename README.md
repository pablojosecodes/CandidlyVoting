# Candidly!

## Overview
I threw together buidtcandidly.com over a day and a half, after discovering the "Build with Claude" contest. It's a web app which uses Claude to help keep voters informed about politicians they vote for. Currently, it tracks candidates from California's Senate 11th District election.

- **Politician Tracking:** Basic profiles of politicians including their ideologies and actions.
- **Search and Filter:** Users can search by zip code and explore politicians' specific remarks or ideologies.
- **Simple Interface:** Easy navigation allows for quick access to needed information.

## How to Use
1. Enter the website and input your zip code.
2. View information about politicians in the 11th District.
3. Use the search tool for deeper insights into each politician.

# The idea
Ideally,  the platform would include a comprehensive repository of politicians' recent speeches, bills, actions, and tweets, offering an up-to-date reflection of their work and opinions. (For now, only had time to index a few tweets / policy decisions).
